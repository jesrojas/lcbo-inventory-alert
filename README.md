The prospect of this project is to be able to send an alert (as it is right now, we are planning around an alert functionability for e-mails, but Telegram alerts is another possibility) when inventory becomes available for the LCBO's hard-to-find inventory.

As it is right now, this respository is a prototype for testing scraping on LCBO's online inventory, according to user input.
